# Recognising-the-captchas-by-ocr-model-using-CNN-and-RNN

CAPTCHAs may be referred to those infuriating images containing the text that needs to be typed in before a person can access a particular website. The full form of CAPTCHA is "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart" and as the name suggests it is a way to avert the computer to fill out the form on its own, automatically. However using the concept of deep learning and computer vision, the very purpose of the CAPTCHAs can be defeated. This test can be passed automatically with the help of Convolutional Neural networks(CNN) - a class of the deep neural networks & Recurrent neural network (RNN) - a class of artificial neural networks. A CNN is an algorithm of deep learning which takes in an image as input and then assigns some value to various features in the image which further helps to differentiate one feature from the other whereas RNN is adapted to work for time series data or data that involves sequences.
This project is built from a simple OCR model with the Functional API thet combines the CNN and RNN and also shows ways to instantiate a Endpoint layer for CTC loss.

## Data Preprocessing & Model building
The dataset consists of images of size 50 height and 200 width. These images first need to be pre-processed before developing the model. For the purpose of training, the images in the dataset have a filename same as the CAPTCHA possessed by the image. The images are first pre-processed by reading them in grayscale. This helps us to remove the noise to some extent as the images get invariant of the background color. Simultaneously, the file name is also stored in a string. Each grayscale image is then scaled and reshaped. Then we create an array of dimension 5*36, used to store the character present at each position in the CAPTCHA. At each position, through filename we find which characters are present at each position of the CAPTCHA and update the corresponding location to one in this array. This array will thus be used for training the model.Thus, after pre-processing we obtain all the grayscale images and the target array containing information regarding the characters present in each CAPTCHA image.

The first layer is the input layer which takes the image as input. Then we have convolutional layers and the max pooling layers which extracts the most prominent feautures from the images. The next layer is the batch normalization layer, used to improve the stability of the model.Then we have a flatten layer which converts the input from max pool layer to a long vector of desired dimensions. This is done so as the further neural network is easily processed and the back propagation is carried out easily. Further there are five dense layers in this neural network each of which is connected to the flatten layer. Each of these dense layers deploys the activation function ‘relu’ to train the parameters. Further to each of these dense layers is connected a dropout layer used for regularisation. Following the dropout layer is again a dense layer which uses the activation function ‘sigmoid’. The sigmoid function is also called a logistic function and it transforms the input to values between 0 and 1.
Thus, the model uses an image of dimension (50, 200, 1) as input and gets output from 5 layers each having dimension 36. The model uses the optimizer ‘Adam’. The model uses loss function as ‘categorical cross entropy’.
